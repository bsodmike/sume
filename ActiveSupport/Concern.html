<div class="description">
  
<p>A typical module looks like this:</p>

<pre>module M
  def self.included(base)
    base.extend ClassMethods
    base.send(:include, InstanceMethods)
    scope :disabled, where(:disabled =&gt; true)
  end

  module ClassMethods
  ...
  end

  module InstanceMethods
  ...
  end
end</pre>

<p>By using <tt>ActiveSupport::Concern</tt> the above module could instead be
written as:</p>

<pre>require 'active_support/concern'

module M
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    scope :disabled, where(:disabled =&gt; true)
  end

  module ClassMethods
  ...
  end

  module InstanceMethods
  ...
  end
end</pre>

<p>Moreover, it gracefully handles module dependencies. Given a <tt>Foo</tt>
module and a <tt>Bar</tt> module which depends on the former, we would
typically write the following:</p>

<pre>module Foo
  def self.included(base)
    base.class_eval do
      def self.method_injected_by_foo
        ...
      end
    end
  end
end

module Bar
  def self.included(base)
    base.method_injected_by_foo
  end
end

class Host
  include Foo # We need to include this dependency for Bar
  include Bar # Bar is the module that Host really needs
end</pre>

<p>But why should <tt>Host</tt> care about <tt>Bar</tt>‘s dependencies,
namely <tt>Foo</tt>? We could try to hide these from <tt>Host</tt> directly
including <tt>Foo</tt> in <tt>Bar</tt>:</p>

<pre>module Bar
include Foo 
  def self.included(base)
    base.method_injected_by_foo
  end
end

class Host
  include Bar
end</pre>

<p>Unfortunately this won’t work, since when <tt>Foo</tt> is included, its
<tt>base</tt> is the <tt>Bar</tt> module, not the <tt>Host</tt> class. With
<tt>ActiveSupport::Concern</tt>, module dependencies are properly resolved:</p>

<pre>require 'active_support/concern'

module Foo
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  included do
    class_eval do
      def self.method_injected_by_foo
        ...
      end
    end
  end
end

module Bar
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  include Foo

  included do
    self.method_injected_by_foo
  end
end

class Host
  include Bar # works, Bar takes care now of its dependencies
end</pre>
